# AshePashe | আশেপাশে

AshePashe is an android app, which is developed for one of my academic projects. Basically the purpose of the app is to help users to find all the available services including health, transport, catering, repairing etc. near them. And the service providers will advertise their services in the app. The users can directly contact with the service provider and also see other users’ rating. So, it helps the users to find their desired service in an efficient way.
